I heard about the Nashvile Software School on the night, Trump was elected. I decided to spend the nail biting night out at a bar in East Nashville surrounded by like minded people. I moved to Nashville the previous month from New Haven, Connecticut.

My final of four spine surgeries over the course of one year, was successful; I was eager to find a purpose again. I was an EMT, about to aply to paramedic school, but in a mere second, on a routine patient lift,it was all gone. The second surgery literally broke my spine. A vertabra was fractured and no stabalizing rods placed. That surgery precipitated two additional surgical revisions, a permanent disability to my left leg, and permanent restrictions to my physical abilities.

The benefit to getting hurt on the job was the financial support for an education to prepare me for a new career, which worker's compensation is providing. 

However, after a six month recovery and two years of not being able to work, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I've barely ever considered a career outside of the medical field. I kicked around the idea of finishing my English degree, but then what? Teach? It seemed like my only reasonable option. But on election night, in that bar, a bombastic blonde told me all about NSS.

So, here I am now, finsihed with the first week and I have no idea what I have gotten myself into. Learning has always come easily to me, not without hard work, but never far beyond a little hard work. Despite the prework, simply setting up my terminal has me feeling a bit hopeless. I mean what are we even doing? And I'm in good company. I have spoken with a handful in the cohort who feel similiarly lost. I'm not sure if hard work alone will save me or that the study skills I have employed in the past will be effective. What I feel right now is a deep humility and maybe the seed of a growing curiosity. I have found the most difficult things to be the most worthwhile. I hope that will be the case here.

We were asked to end every week with a blog entry about what we learned:

- How to install a shell for me terminal. The terminal which I was onky vaguley aware even existed. 
- On the second day we saw an earlier cohorts front-end capstones. I cannot imagine being where they are in three months.
    -Lessons they shared:
        -trust the process
        -be willing to pivot on approaches to coding
        -learn from and work with classmates. (I plan on starting a study group ASAP when I figure out who my people are)

We breifly went over HTML and CSS, which I think the pre-work prepared me for, mostly. We learned to make a repo and work with GitHub. I just finished making and deleting a few repos to get used to the flow. Both petrifid of and excited for next week.
