                <h1>Breaking Back</h1>
                <h3><i>The Journey of a Fledling Software Engineer</i></h3>
                <article>
                    <h3>No, When I Say Literally, I Mean It...</h3>
                    <p>I heard about the Nashvile Software School on the night, Trump was elected. I decided to spend the nail biting night out at a bar in East Nashville surrounded by like minded people. I moved to Nashville the previous month from New
                        Haven, Connecticut.</p>
                    <p>My final of four spine surgeries over the course of one year, was successful; I was eager to find a purpose again. I was an EMT, about to aply to paramedic school, but in a mere second, on a routine patient lift,it was all gone. The
                        second surgery literally broke my spine. A vertabra was fractured and no stabalizing rods placed. That surgery precipitated two additional surgical revisions, a permanent disability to my left leg, and permanent restrictions to
                        my physical abilities. The benefit to getting hurt on the job was the financial support for an education to prepare me for a new career, which worker's compensation is providing.</p>

                    <p>However, after a six month recovery and two years of not being able to work, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I've barely ever considered a career outside of the medical field. I kicked around the idea of finishing my English degree,
                        but then what? Teach? It seemed like my only reasonable option. But on election night, in that bar, a bombastic blonde told me all about NSS. So, here I am now, finsihed with the first week and I have no idea what I have gotten
                        myself into. Learning has always come easily to me, not without hard work, but never far beyond a little hard work. Despite the prework, simply setting up my terminal has me feeling a bit hopeless. I mean what are we even doing?
                        And I'm in good company. I have spoken with a handful in the cohort who feel similiarly lost. I'm not sure if hard work alone will save me or that the study skills I have employed in the past will be effective. What I feel right
                        now is a deep humility and maybe the seed of a growing curiosity. I have found the most difficult things to be the most worthwhile. I hope that will be the case here. We were asked to end every week with a blog entry about what
                        we learned:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How to install a shell for me terminal. The terminal of which I was only vaguley aware even existed.</li>
                        <li>On the second day we saw an earlier cohorts front-end capstones. I cannot imagine being where they are in three months.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <p>Lessons they shared:</p>
                            <li>trust the process</li>
                            <li>be willing to pivot on approaches to coding</li>
                            <li>learn from and work with classmates. (I plan on starting a study group ASAP when I figure out who my people are)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We breifly went over HTML and CSS, which I think the pre-work prepared me for, mostly. We learned to make a repo and work with GitHub. I just finished making and deleting a few repos to get used to the flow. Both petrifid of and excited
                        for next week.</p>

                    <h3>Morels in Tennessee</h3>
                    <p>Few mushrooms in the wild resemble morels, and the ones that do can be easily distinguished based on key defining features. The yellow morel, for instance, retains a hollow and pitted head. Likewise, a cross-section of the stalk typically
                        reveals a hollow interior. Additionally, the cap is attached to the stalk.</p>
                    <p>Look for morels in old apple orchards or in burned areas. They’re also associated with tulip poplar, ash, beech, maple, and dead or dying elm trees. In the eastern United States, they can be found in the spring months through early
                        summer.

                    <h3>The Unmistakable Lion's Mane Mushroom</h3>
                    <p>Not all mushrooms look like the portobellos and the shiitakes found in the grocery store. Lion’s mane, for one, certainly does not. It is one of the most unique-looking mushrooms, with its unbranched body of icicle-like spines and
                        soft white tissue. Accordingly, lion’s mane is a great mushroom for beginning mushroom hunters.</p>
                    <p>Also known as the pom-pom mushroom, lion’s mane is one of the most delectable mushrooms in the fungal kingdom, resembling crab meat in taste and texture. Additionally, lion’s mane has been well researched for its role in improving
                        cognitive health, producing neuro-regenerative effects in numerous studies. Look for lion’s mane on the wounds of living hardwood trees, such as oaks and maples, as well as on recently felled trees. It can be found in the summer
                        months through autumn.</p>

                    <h3>The Bright and Meaty Chicken of the Woods</h3>
                    <p>Chicken of the woods (chicken mushroom, sulphur shelf) grows in clusters on both standing and downed trees, emerging as knob-like growths and soon developing into numerous shelves. The color is an unmistakable yellowish-orange, and
                        the pore surface is yellow (for L. sulphureus, and white for the closely related L. cincinnatus … both edible). Always make sure the underside has pores. If it has gills, you won’t be having chicken for dinner.</p>
                    <p>The chicken mushroom resembles … get this … chicken in taste and texture, and is best collected when young. As it ages, the chicken mushroom becomes too tough to eat, though the outer edges can still be salvaged and used in dishes.
                        Like all wild mushrooms, it requires cooking before consumption.</p>

                    <h3>The Trickier Maitake</h3>
                    <p>The maitake mushroom (sheep’s head, hen-of-the-woods) is a choice edible and medicinal that always demands a good hunt. While it’s easy to identify and widely distributed, the maitake mushroom can be somewhat tricky to locate compared
                        to the showy chicken mushroom, as the former blends in well with the autumnal foliage. Maitake contains overlapping gray to brown caps attached to a single base. Individual specimens can be rather large and weigh several pounds.
                        Like other polypores (mushroom fruiting bodies with pores or tubes on the underside), maitake has no gills.</p>
                    <p>Maitake compliments a variety of dishes, lending a hearty flavor and tender texture. In addition to its use as a food, maitake has been researched extensively for its medicinal properties, specifically in the areas of cancer and diabetes.</p>
